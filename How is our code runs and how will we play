Certainly! Let's break down the steps of the Simon game as implemented in the code you provided:

1. **Game Initialization**:
   - The game starts when a key on the keyboard is pressed. The game level is set to 0, and the `started` variable is set to `false`.
   - When a key is pressed, the game initializes by updating the title to show the current level and calling the `nextSequence()` function to generate the first color pattern.

2. **Generating a Color Pattern**:
   - The `nextSequence()` function generates the next color pattern for the game:
     - The user's clicked pattern is reset to an empty array.
     - The level increases by 1, and the title is updated to show the current level.
     - A random number is generated to select a color from the `buttonColours` array.
     - The chosen color is added to the `gamePattern` array.
     - The chosen color's button element is animated to create a blinking effect.
     - The `playSound()` function is called to play the sound corresponding to the chosen color.

Certainly! Let's break down the steps of the Simon game as implemented in the code you provided:

1. **Game Initialization**:
   - The game starts when a key on the keyboard is pressed. The game level is set to 0, and the `started` variable is set to `false`.
   - When a key is pressed, the game initializes by updating the title to show the current level and calling the `nextSequence()` function to generate the first color pattern.

2. **Generating a Color Pattern**:
   - The `nextSequence()` function generates the next color pattern for the game:
     - The user's clicked pattern is reset to an empty array.
     - The level increases by 1, and the title is updated to show the current level.
     - A random number is generated to select a color from the `buttonColours` array.
     - The chosen color is added to the `gamePattern` array.
     - The chosen color's button element is animated to create a blinking effect.
     - The `playSound()` function is called to play the sound corresponding to the chosen color.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - The user can click on color buttons with the class `.btn` to interact with the game.
   - When a button is clicked, the following actions occur:
     - The clicked color is added to the `userClickedPattern` array.
     - The `playSound()` function is called to play the corresponding sound.
     - The `animatePress()` function is called to briefly highlight the clicked button.
     - The `checkAnswer()` function is called to compare the user's pattern with the game's pattern.

4. **Checking User's Answer**:
   - The `checkAnswer()` function is responsible for comparing the user's clicked pattern with the game's pattern:
     - If the colors match and the user's pattern is the same length as the game's pattern, the user proceeds to the next level.
     - If the colors don't match, the game ends, a "wrong" sound is played, and the user is prompted to restart.
